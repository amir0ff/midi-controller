# üéöÔ∏èüéõÔ∏èüéöÔ∏è MIDI Controller on Arduino (Pro) Micro 5V/16MHz

This is a generic MIDI controller for DJs and music producers built on the ATmega32u4 microcontroller.
It has been tested on Native Instrument's Traktor Pro 2 and Ableton Live 10 and should work on other versions alike.

*It doesn't require any external software such as "The Hairless MIDI" since this is a MIDI over USB Class Compliant device.*

### MIDI mapping:
MIDI In can be assigned from the software to any knob, fader or button you map it to. MIDI Out has to be configured in the `readMIDI()` method in the code and mapped in the software.
##### Traktor Pro 2 (MIDI Out) mappings:
* MIDI Channel = 4
* MIDI CC 80 = Filter On (Deck A)
* MIDI CC 81 = Monitor Cue On (Deck A)
* MIDI CC 84 = Deck Focus Selector (Deck A)
* MIDI CC 82 = Filter On (Deck B)
* MIDI CC 83 = Monitor Cue On (Deck B)
* MIDI CC 85 = Deck Focus Selector (Deck B)
